## Tic Tac Toe Using Python
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where opponents take turns marking an empty 3x3 grid with their respective symbols, traditionally "X" and "O," in a race to complete a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol. In this Python project, we have created a simple yet engaging implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Why Python for Game Development?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It uses concise and clear syntax, making it ideal for beginners and experienced developers. Python is versatile, supporting various applications such as web development, data analysis, automation, and more, making it a widely-used language in various domains.

## Step 1: Create the Game Board

Initialize the game board, typically represented as a 3x3 grid, with empty spaces. You can use a nested list or another data structure to represent the board.

## Step 2: Display the Game Board

Create a function to display the current state of the game board, showing the positions where players can make their moves.

## Step 3: Get Player Input

Write a function that allows players to input their moves. This function should handle input validation to ensure the move is within the bounds of the board and on an empty space.

## Step 4: Check for a Winner

After each player's move, check if they have won the game. This involves checking rows, columns, and diagonals to see if they contain the same symbol.

## Step 5: Check for a Tie

After each player's move, check if the game has resulted in a tie

## Step 6: Switch Players

Implement a mechanism to switch between players after each move, so that they take turns.

## Step 7: Play the Game

Create a loop that runs until a player wins or the game ends in a tie. Inside the loop display the game board, get player input, and check for a winner or tie.

## Step 8: Declare a Winner or a Tie

When the game loop ends, declare the winner if there is one, or announce a tie if there are no available moves left.

## Step 9: Play Again Option

Offer players the option to start a new game after the current one has concluded. If they choose to play again, reset the game board and continue from Step 7.

## Step 10: End the Game

Provide an option for players to exit the game gracefully when they are done playing.
