# Tic-Tac-Toe-
ic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where opponents take turns marking an empty 3x3 grid with their respective symbols, traditionally "X" and "O," in a race to complete a row, column, or diagonal with their symbol. In this Python project, we have created a simple yet engaging implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
